Uno is shedding game involving 2 players. At the beginning, each player receives 7 cards and the winner is determined as the first player with no cards left. In order to get rid of a card, a player must match either the color and number of the card on top of the discard pile. If the player does not have a card to discard, then it will take a card from the Draw pile. The deck of cards include 4 colors (blue, green, yellow, and red), 10 numbers (0 to 9), and special cards (Wild Draw Four, Skip, Reverse).

Our implementation wraps [RLCard](http://rlcard.org/games.html#uno) and you can refer to its documentation for additional details. Please cite their work if you use this game in research.


#### Observation Space

The observation space has a shape of (7, 4, 15). The first index represent the plane, the second index the color, and the last index the card number (including any special card).

| Plane | Feature                                                   |
| :---: | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Player's Hand with 0 cards of the same color and number   |
| 1     | Player's Hand with 1 card of the same color and number    |
| 2     | Player's Hand with 2 cards of the same color and number   |
| 3     | Target card (top of the Discard pile)                     |
| 4     | Opponent's Hand with 0 cards of the same color and number |
| 5     | Opponent's Hand with 1 cards of the same color and number |
| 6     | Opponent's Hand with 2 cards of the same color and number |

For example, you would use action `6` to put down a red "6" card or action `60` to draw a card.

#### Rewards

| Winner | Loser |
| :----: | :---: |
| +1     | -1    |

#### Legal Moves

The legal moves available for each agent, found in `env.infos[agent]['legal_moves']`, are updated after each step. Taking an illegal move ends the game with a reward of -1 for the illegally moving agent and a reward of 0 for all other agents.
